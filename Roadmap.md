So, I think maybe I'll make a generic SVG editor dealio? ish?
Like, no reason to ... tie in the geo stuff, right? I think.
I mean I guess it could be useful.

Anyway, first order of business is to not do that.

THINGS WE DO:
- draw a rectangle, crop the heck out of it. all paths crop to it stat.
	I hope cropping works, my folks. hope hope hope.

Expand 20 round, contract 20 round -- makes tand-5.svg, which is pretty solid tbh.
I'd rather have bevel'ed contract though, because the round contract makes everything
look like it was made by a melon baller. which isn't quite necessary.


Ok, so after I have a basically-working coastline normalizer...

I need to have the other things exported.
