Expand 20 round, contract 20 round -- makes tand-5.svg, which is pretty solid tbh.
I'd rather have bevel'ed contract though, because the round contract makes everything
look like it was made by a melon baller. which isn't quite necessary.


Ok, so after I have a basically-working coastline normalizer...

I need to have the other things exported.
